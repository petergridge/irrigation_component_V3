# Irrigation Component V3
The driver for this project is to provide an easy to configure user interface for the gardener of the house. The goal is that once the inital configuration is done all the features can be modified through lovelace cards. 

The provided working test harness is self contained with dummy switches and rain sensor that can be used to become familiar with the capabilities of the component and a sample of LoveLace configuration that uses the Entities card with conditions and the Conditions Card to simplify the UI.

All the inputs of the platform are Home Assistant entities for example the start time is provided via a input_datetime entity. The information is evaluated to trigger the irrigation action according to the inputs provided.

Watering can occur in an Eco mode where a water/wait/repeat cycle is run to minimise run off by letting water soak as a by using several short watering cycles. The wait and repeat configuration is optional if you only want to water for a single lengthy period of time.

The rain sensor is implemented as a binary_sensor, this allows practically any combination of sensors to suspend the irrigation. 

Implemented as a switch you can start a program manually or using an automation.

Only one program can run at a time to prevent multiple solenoids being activated. If program start times result in an overlap the running program will be stopped.

Manually starting a program by turning the switch on will not evaluate the rain sensor, as there is an assumption that there is an intent to run the program.

## INSTALLATION

### To create a working sample
* Copy the irrigationprogram folder to the ‘config/custom components/’ directory 
* Copy the 'irrigation.yaml' file to the packages directory or into configuration.yaml. Sample configuration
* Restart Home Assistant
* For each of the 'card.yaml' files found in the lovelace directory, add a manual card and copy the yaml into card

### Important
* Make sure that all of the objects you reference i.e. input_boolean, switch etc are defined or you will get errors when the irrigationprogram is triggered. Check the log for errors.

### Pre-requisite
* The time_date integration is required
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
```

### Debug
Add the following to your logger section configuration.yaml
```yaml
logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
        custom_components.irrigationprogram: debug
```

### Rain Sensor feature
If a rain sensor is not defined the zone will always run at the nominated start time.

If the irrigation program is run manually the rain sensor value is ignored and all zones will run.

The rain sensor can be optionally defined in each zone. You can:
* Define the same sensor for each zone 
* Have a different sensor for different areas
* Configure the ability to ignore the rain sensor

### Watering Adjuster feature
As an alternative to the rain sensor you can also use the watering adjustment. With this feature the integrator is responsible to provide the value using a input_number component. I imagine that this would be based on weather data or a moisture sensor.

Setting *water_adjustment* attribute allows a factor to be applied to the watering time.

* If the factor is 0 no watering will occur
* If the factor is 0.5 watering will run for only half the configured watering time. Wait and repeat attributes are unaffected.

The following automation is an example of how the input_number.adjust_run_time could be maintained
```yaml
automation:
- id: '1553507967550'
  alias: rain adjuster
  mode: restart
  trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/1"
  action:
    - service: input_number.set_value
      entity_id: input_number.rain_adjuster
      data:
        value: "{{ value template calculation }}"
```

### Run Days and Run Frequency
Run Days and Run frequency allows the definition of when the program to be controlled. Only one value can be provided in the program configuration.

* *Run Days* supports water restrictions impose in Australia alowing watering to occur on specific days only
* *Run Frequncy* allows the water to occur at a specified frequency, for example, every 3 days.


### ECO feature
The ECO feature allows multiple small watering cycles to be configure for a zone in the program to minimise run off and wastage. Setting the optional configuration of the Wait, Repeat attributes of a zone will enable the feature. 

* *wait* sets the length of time to wait between watering cycles
* *repeat* defines the number of watering cycles to run
